I continued with the GameMaker 8.0 version of the game over the summer trying to implement infinite rooms by locking the player in the center of the room. Near the end of the summer, there was a sale on GameMaker Studio 1.4, so I started porting the game over. Due to problems with the physics engine and locking the player in the center of the room, I didn\u2019t end up finishing the Gamemaker port.
